⚡ fun fact: i used to be a video editor/content producer who decided to switch careers. i have always wanted to be a developer, but life led me to a different path. i decided to finally listen to my grandma, who said, back in 2002, "you should work with this *computer thing* since you like it so much".<br /><br />
